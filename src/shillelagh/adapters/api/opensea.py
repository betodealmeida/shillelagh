    # true, and the adapter should return as soon as possible. This means that if
    # you need to do a network request to determine if the URI should be handled
    # by your adapter, when ``fast=True`` you should return ``None``.

    # On the second call, ``fast`` will be false, and the adapter can make network

    # When defining columns it's important to know which columns can be used to
    # filter the URI. For example, if the API accepts a time range the adapter
    # probably needs a temporal column that is filterable:
    #
    #     from shillelagh.fields import DateTime
    #     from shillelagh.filters import Range
    #
    #     self.columns["time"] = DateTime(filters=[Range])
    #
    # It's then up to the ``get_rows`` method to translate temporal filters into
    # the corresponding API calls.
    #
    # The column definition should also specify if the column has a natural order,
    # or if the adapter can handle any requested order (and the adapter will be
    # responsible for ordering the data):
    #
    #     from shillelagh.fields import Integer
    #     from shillelagh.fields import Order
    #
    #     self.columns["prime_numbers"] = Integer(
    #         filters=[Range],
    #         order=Order.ASCENDING,
    #     )
    #
    # Finally, columns can return data that is not filtered perfectly â€” eg, hourly
    # data filtered only down to the daily granularity. In that case the column
    # should be declared as inexact:
    #
    #     self.columns["time"] = DateTime(filters=[Range], exact=False)
    #
    def _set_columns(self) -> None:
        self.columns: Dict[str, Field] = {}

    # get rid of ``_set_columns``, and simply define the columns as class
    # attributes:
    #
    # time = DateTime(filters=[Range])
    #
    # Then ``get_columns`` from the parent class will find these attributes and
    # use them as the dictionary of columns.

        return self.columns

    # This method is used to return any extra metadata associated with the URI.
